Editing files with C++ and Curses.

BUILDING
Inside the "source/" directory, there should be a config header named 
"config.h". Inside the config header, there are several options. Edit until all 
the settings are set. Currently it is set to build on Windows with PDCurses.

Inside the "tools/" directory, there are several scripts. There are several 
options that should be dealt with, including with the compiler, linker, and 
other important settings. Currently, it is set to build on Windows with MSYS2 
and `mingw32-w64`. There are several variants of "build.sh". Here are the 
differences:

tools/build.sh
- builds the editor

tools/build_wo.sh
- builds the editor
- clears the screen before displaying output

tools/build_and_run.sh
- builds the editor
- runs if build was successful

An honarable mention is
tools/run.sh
- runs the first parameter

Honestly, I am not sure why it was included.
